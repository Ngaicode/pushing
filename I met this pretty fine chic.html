<h1 style="color: aqua">next time I see her I swear i'll shoot my shot</h1>
<h2>she was lovely</h2>
<p>i absolutely loved everything about her
her complexion,the way she was dressed,oh God!
and when we made eye contact,i felt something warm inside me</p>
<h2>haha,i sound like i'm in love</h2>
<p>i hope i get to see her again
i might have to pass by TUK everyday so I get to see her </p>
<h3>sucks being a hopeless romantic</h3>
<p>there's something special about holding eye contact intentionally ;something so magical</p>
